# gateway

This repository contains a small Flask backend and static frontend used to compare responses from different AI models. The backend exposes `/openai` and `/gemini` routes, while the frontend provides a simple interface for submitting prompts.

Run the backend locally with:

```bash
python3 local_backend.py
```

Then open `index.html` in a browser.
